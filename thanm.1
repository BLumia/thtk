.Sh BUGS
A few files from TH12 contain overlapping entries with different formats.
Dumping and recreating these archives will not result in the same archives.
The affected pixels seem to all have 0 for alpha though.
.Pp
One of the scripts in TH95's front.anm lack a sentinel instruction.
Dumping and recreating this archive will add a sentinel instruction.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
File names may not be properly sanitized when extracting.
Furthermode, invalid data may not be properly handled.
Do not operate on untrusted files.
